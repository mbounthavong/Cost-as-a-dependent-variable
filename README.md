## Workshop Materials
Files for the "Cost as a dependent variable" presentation at VA HERC Econometrics Cyberseminar series

Data used for this exericse comes from the Agency for Health Research and Quality (AHRQ) Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) [2017 Full-Year Consolidated Data File](https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/download_data_files_detail.jsp?cboPufNumber=HC-201). 

I parsed the 2017 Full-Year Consolidated Datat File for this workshop to only the essential variables, which is located in the ["Data" folder](https://github.com/mbounthavong/Cost-as-a-dependent-variable/tree/main/Data).

The Stata code (*.do file) for this workshop is located in the following [folder](https://github.com/mbounthavong/Cost-as-a-dependent-variable/tree/main/Stata%20Do%20file). I used Stata SE 18 to generate the code.

I also wrote an R tutorial on two-part models, which is located on my [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/mbounthavong/two-part-model-in-r) site.
